# ImageClassifier---Part1

The project is a part of the assigment to Create a Image Classifier in the program - 

AI Programming with Python NanoDegree with Udacity

The project has uses to classify images that are given as input to the model.

There are Python libraries like 

1.Numpy

2.Seaborn

3.Matplotlib

4.Torchvision of Pytorch 

implemented for the above purpose.

The project loads a pretrained model like VGG16 to classify these images.

It also incorporates Serialization and hepls to save checkpoint and also rebuild the model from the checkpoint.

Dataloaders are implemented to load the datasets from ImageNet.

It is a small implementation as a contribution for the NanoDegree with Udacity
